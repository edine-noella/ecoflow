# 🌱 EcoFlow - Smart Waste Management System

EcoFlow is an AI-powered waste classification and disposal guidance system. It helps users identify waste types through image recognition and provides guidance on how to properly dispose of it. The system also features a reward mechanism for eco-friendly actions.

## 🚀 Features
- **User Authentication**: login & signup.
- **Waste Classification**: Upload an image to check waste type.
- **Disposal Station Locator**: Find nearby waste disposal bins.
- **Rewards System**: Earn and claim points for responsible disposal.
- **Profile Management**: View your user profile.

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Waste pollution is one of most major current issues that accelerates climate change, harms our environment, and endangers wildlife. Many people in Africa and specifically in Rwanda don’t know how to properly dispose of their waste and have no clear or simple guidance on how to do so. As a result, recyclable and compostable waste often ends up in the wrong places, contributing to pollution which will continue to threaten biodiversity and public health.
